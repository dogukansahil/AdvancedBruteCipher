# BruteCipher

Welcome to BruteCipher, a simple and secure encryption tool inspired by historical figures. This is the beta version of our project, and we are constantly working on improving its features and security.

##Demo

[Demo](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/dogukansahil/BruteCipher/blob/main/index.html){:target="_blank"}

## Features
- Encrypt and decrypt text using a robust algorithm
- Easy-to-use interface
- Secure key management
- No external CDN dependencies
- All operations are performed locally in your browser using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dogukansahil/BruteCipher.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd BruteCipher
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to use the tool.

## Usage

1. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
2. Provide the necessary keys.
3. Click on the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button to see the result.

## Extended Description

BruteCipher aims to provide a user-friendly and secure way to manage text encryption and decryption without relying on external services or CDNs. All operations are performed locally in your browser using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, ensuring that your data remains private and secure.

### Key Features

- **Local Processing**: All encryption and decryption processes occur locally within your browser, meaning your data is never shared with external servers.
- **Robust Algorithm**: Utilizes a double hashing algorithm for enhanced security, inspired by the historical figure Brutus.
- **Secure Key Management**: Manage your encryption keys securely within your browser.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy encryption and decryption.

### How It Works

- **Double Hashing Algorithm**: The algorithm applies two rounds of hashing to the input text, with each round using a different key. This makes it significantly harder for unauthorized parties to decrypt the data without the correct keys.
- **Key Management**: Users can generate and store their keys locally, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed to external threats.
- **Passphrase Protection**: A 4-digit passphrase can be used to export and import keys, adding an extra layer of security and convenience.

### Future Plans

We are continuously working on enhancing BruteCipher. Future updates will include:
- Improved user interface
- Enhanced security features
- Support for more complex encryption algorithms
- Integration with local password storage systems

## Important Notice

**Warning:** This is a beta version. Do not use BruteCipher for important or sensitive information at this stage. We recommend waiting for the stable release for critical use cases.
